      <p class='aboutP'>Twas long ago in the sordid annals of history that I, Pat Cookman, did battle with the great and mighty Salmon Lord for control of the cookie capital. I was the Lord's right hand man, his most trusted servicemen, but all the while I toiled under him I was hatching a plan, a plan to steal the Salmon Cookie throne from right under his nose. This chance did not come immediately, however, the Salmon Lord is a cold and calculating being, never letting slip the true secret to the salmon cookie formula for 18 years while I slaved away, climbing the ranks in the cookie capital and finally, one fateful day when I had gained the Salmon Lord's full and unwavering trust, he let it slip. The secret to the salmon cookies. I had all I needed, I fled the cookie compound the next morning at daybreak undetected. Long did I roam the land, scouring every country and city for a spot to begin the establishment of my new cookie empire. Then I found it, a hidden gem, nestled away in the Pacific North West of the United States, a little city called Seattle. I knew it the moment I stepped off the plane, clean, fresh air, beautiful scenery, and a growing city, perfect for the start of a new cookie empire. But little did I know, the Salmon Lord was not so easly fooled, he'd been tailing me the entire time, watching my every move, waiting for me to falter so he could strike. I have not faltered, I will not let that wicked fish of a being take me down, I will rise up and I will overcome his monstrous, vile, disgusting, pure evil cookie caper he's running. The world will stand for it no longer.</p>
